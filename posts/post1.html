<p class="lead text-justify">Belongs to associations are awesome right ! But in recent dealings with developers I have seen some shocking ways to implement it.</p>

<br>

<p class="lead text-justify" > Let's take for example a reddit type application where we have a User model and we have a Post model. So posts belong to users and users have many posts. </p>

<br>

<p class="lead text-justify" > The wrong way of doing this is </p>

<pre>
	<code hljs language='ruby'>
Rails g model Post title:string content:text  user_id:string
	</code>
</pre>

<p>And then in your model</p>

<pre>
	<code hljs >
class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
	belongs_to: user 
end
	</code>
</pre>

<p class="lead text-justify">The right way of doing this is</p>
<br>
<pre><code hljs language='ruby'>
Rails g model Post title:string content:text  user:belongs_to
</span>
</code></pre>

<p class="lead text-justify">This way the model will be created with the belongs_to association there already!
</p>

Remember as devs we want to be fast so we can move on to more awesome code ! Don't make more work for yourself !</p>
