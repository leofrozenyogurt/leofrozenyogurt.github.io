Belongs to associations are awesome right ! But in recent dealings with developers I have seen some shocking ways to implement it.

Let's take for example a reddit type application where we have a User model and we have a Post model. So posts belong to users and users have many posts.

The wrong way of doing this is

Rails g model Post title:string content:text  user_id:string

And then in your model

Post
Belongs_to

The right way of doing this is

Rails g model Post title:string content:text  user:belongs_to

This way the model will be created with the belongs_to association there already!

Remember as devs we want to be fast so we can move on to more awesome code ! Don't make more work for yourself !
